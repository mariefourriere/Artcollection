It must be so essentially sculpture that it can exist in no other way, something completely the right size but which has growth, something still and yet having movement, so very quiet and yet with a real vitality."_(B.Hepworth)_ '

Constructed via the process of hand-sewing, the piece floats over the trench coat so as to move independently. The piece took over 300 hours to make over the course of several months before being shown at Paris Couture Fashion Week. The piece has been purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.'
